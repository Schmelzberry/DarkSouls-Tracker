      <p>In Dark Souls, the armor system is a crucial aspect of the game, influencing the player character's defenses and appearance. Here are the key points regarding the armor system in Dark Souls 1:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Armor Types: There are several types of armor, including helmets, chest pieces, gauntlets, and leggings. Players can mix and match these pieces to create their preferred combination of protection and aesthetics.</li>
        <li>Weight Classes: Armor in Dark Souls is categorized into weight classes - Light, Medium, and Heavy. Wearing heavier armor provides better protection but increases the character's equip burden, affecting mobility and stamina regeneration.</li>
        <li>Poise: Poise is a stat associated with armor that determines the character's ability to withstand hits without being interrupted. Heavier armor generally has higher poise, making it more difficult for enemies to stagger the player during attacks.</li>
        <li>Upgrading: Players can upgrade certain armor sets at blacksmiths using Titanite Shards, Large Titanite Shards, and Titanite Chunks. This improves the armor's defensive capabilities.</li>
        <li>Resistance Stats: Each armor piece provides resistance to various types of damage such as physical, magical, fire, and lightning. Players can choose armor sets based on the types of enemies they expect to encounter.</li>
        <li>Fashion Souls: The community has coined the term "Fashion Souls" to describe the practice of choosing armor for its appearance rather than its statistical benefits. Players often create unique and stylish combinations without sacrificing too much in terms of defense.</li>
        <li>Havel's Ring is an important item in the game that increases maximum equip load, allowing players to wear heavier armor while maintaining a faster movement speed. It is particularly useful for those who prefer heavier, more protective armor sets.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Overall, the armor system in Dark Souls 1 encourages players to find a balance between protection, mobility, and aesthetics based on their preferred playstyle and the challenges they face in the game.</p>
